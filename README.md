### What I learned

I learned the most important thing during solving challenge is that SASS is more usable and flexible to use instead of simple CSS. We can define varibles and functions I can maintain a proper hierarchy for our peoject. Flexbox makes work easy to design mobile layout and I suggest we always hav to go first for mobile design and then look for dekstop design.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<section class="cards-wrapper">
  <article class="image-card">
    <img
      src="./images/image-header-mobile.jpg"
      alt="girls working on laptop"
      class="mobile-image image"
    />
    <img
      src="./images/image-header-desktop.jpg"
      alt="girls working on laptop"
      class="desktop-image image"
    />
  </article>
  <article class="stats-card">
    <h1 class="main-heading">
      Get <span class="link">insights</span> that help your business grow.
    </h1>
    <p class="description">
      Discover the benefits of data analytics and make better decisions
      regarding revenue, customer experience, and overall efficiency.
    </p>
    <section class="stats-container">
      <article class="stats">
        <h2 class="stats-count">10k+</h2>
        <p class="stats-for">companies</p>
      </article>
      <article class="stats">
        <h2 class="stats-count">314</h2>
        <p class="stats-for">templates</p>
      </article>
      <article class="stats">
        <h2 class="stats-count">12m+</h2>
        <p class="stats-for">queries</p>
      </article>
    </section>
  </article>
</section>
```

```css
@mixin flexBox($direction, $justify, $align, $gap) {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: $direction;
  justify-content: $justify;
  align-items: $align;
  gap: $gap;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) - This helped me for understanding flexbox and it's different properites. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Dev Ed SASS ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz6eOVaaelI) - This is an amazing video which helped me finally understand SASS. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
